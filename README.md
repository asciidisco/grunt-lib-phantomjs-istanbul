## This utilizes these libraries:
### [puppeteer](https://github.com/GoogleChrome/puppeteer/blob/master/docs/api.md)
 - essentially a javascript api around chrome-drivers that allow for easy interoperability with a chromium browser.

### [node-ipc](https://www.npmjs.com/package/node-ipc)
 - a socket library that makes handing events much easier for child processes and abstracts out some of the esoteric aspects of socket ipc communication

## Inspired by:
### [electron/spectron](https://github.com/electron/spectron/)
 - a testing suite using chrome-drivers for electron applications

### [davidtaylorhq/qunit-puppeteer](https://github.com/davidtaylorhq/qunit-puppeteer/blob/master/bin/qunit-puppeteer.js)
 - a simple runner for qunit tests with puppeteer
